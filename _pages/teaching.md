## Select Feedback

"She was very good at explaining code and breaking it down and made it very understandable. Walking into this class, 
I was very intimidated, as I had never coded in my life before. R studio was entirely new to me, and I was very nervous to take this class. 
After the first discussion, I was a lot more confident because she explained everything so well and was very
patient when we did not understand something. She was willing to explain code until it was clear and if
we did not understand, we always knew she was available for office hours. Elayne was very
approachable and I felt very comfortable asking her for help because even when I was really confused,
she never made it seem that being confused was a bad thing."

"I would 100% recommend Elayne as a TA to my peers and I would take her discussion again. Also, Elayne is an amazing speaker and she
made discussion interesting and engaging. I never felt bored in her discussions, instead, I would look
forward to them because they were well organized and they were not a repetition of lecture. She always
expanded on the course material and her discussions were very well prepared every time."

"Stecher was an incredible guide in helping my classmates and I formulate our experiment proposal! She
provided useful feedback while supporting our collective creation. I would say that would be one of her
greatest strengths, because in a class of 20 students I wouldn't have expected collaborative work to run
that smoothly. Another strength of hers that I must include is her patience and ability to explain things in
multiple ways when my classmates or I didn't fully understand something the first time."

"Elayne is awesome. She is so knowledgeable, but very approachable and explains things in an
extremely digestible manner. She has improved my course understanding so much. I really value how
she constantly challenges us to improve our thinking, but never in a harsh or discouraging manner. She
is definitely one of, if not the best, TA I have ever had."

"I really liked the way that Elayne explained things. She managed to make the readings very easy to
understand and was very accessible as a TA. I went to one of her office hours once and I left feeling like
I understood everything a lot better. She was also a fair grader and really took the time to put
meaningful comments on each of her student's midterms. Her optional review sessions also helped me
do well in the class."

"I really liked Elayne, she is not only super knowledgable about the topics we discussed, but she is also
very open to other topics of discussion. I was a very nervous transfer student and felt super lost in class.
When I came to UCLA, and I had always been told reach out to the TA's and
I'm very happy that I reached out to Elayne. Elayne's strengths are that she is passionate about
teaching and student understanding even within a (somewhat) specialized course like War and
Diplomacy. She went above and beyond to create resources for our section that helped with reading
strategies, and organizing the theories within our class. SUPER HELPFUL. I dont really have a comment for 
improvement for Elayne because she was by far the most helpful individual I have
encountered at UCLA thus far."
