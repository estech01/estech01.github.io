## Select Teaching Evaluation Feedback

### PS156A

"Elayne was genuinely the best TA I have ever had. She was approachable, friendly, and exceptionally
knowledgeable about the course material. I happened to really enjoy attending section all quarter long
because she fostered critical thinking skills and familiarized her students with strategies to help make
the content more digestible. In addition to her great explanations and simplifications of difficult concepts,
one of Elayne's strengths is how well she fostered a collaborative learning environment. She
encouraged us to work with our peers and diversify our knowledge of the material we were learning, all
while allowing us to do so in an inclusive and even fun setting."

"Elayne is simply an incredible TA. On top of all else that she does, she dedicated her time to make sure
we succeeded in the class. The structure of her discussion sections consisted of a combination of small
group work and large group discussions. I felt this perfectly allowed everyone to feel comfortable
speaking out to the whole class, and I felt like my understanding of the readings always expanded with
discussion with my peers. Outside of this, she was always understanding of our workload and tried to
help us as much as possible by giving us reading and studying techniques. In my opinion, she is also
quite a funny and enjoyable person, she always made discussion section light despite it's late time in
the day."

### PS179

"She was very good at explaining code and breaking it down and made it very understandable. Walking into this class, 
I was very intimidated, as I had never coded in my life before. R studio was entirely new to me, and I was very nervous to take this class. 
After the first discussion, I was a lot more confident because she explained everything so well and was very
patient when we did not understand something. She was willing to explain code until it was clear and if
we did not understand, we always knew she was available for office hours. Elayne was very
approachable and I felt very comfortable asking her for help because even when I was really confused,
she never made it seem that being confused was a bad thing." 

"Stecher was an incredible guide in helping my classmates and I formulate our experiment proposal! She
provided useful feedback while supporting our collective creation. I would say that would be one of her
greatest strengths, because in a class of 20 students I wouldn't have expected collaborative work to run
that smoothly. Another strength of hers that I must include is her patience and ability to explain things in
multiple ways when my classmates or I didn't fully understand something the first time."

### PS129

"Elayne is awesome. She is so knowledgeable, but very approachable and explains things in an
extremely digestible manner. She has improved my course understanding so much. I really value how
she constantly challenges us to improve our thinking, but never in a harsh or discouraging manner. She
is definitely one of, if not the best, TA I have ever had."

"I really liked the way that Elayne explained things. She managed to make the readings very easy to
understand and was very accessible as a TA. I went to one of her office hours once and I left feeling like
I understood everything a lot better. She was also a fair grader and really took the time to put
meaningful comments on each of her student's midterms. Her optional review sessions also helped me
do well in the class."
