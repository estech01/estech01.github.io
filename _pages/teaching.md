"Elayne is awesome. She is so knowledgeable, but very approachable and explains things in an
extremely digestible manner. She has improved my course understanding so much. I really value how
she constantly challenges us to improve our thinking, but never in a harsh or discouraging manner. She
is definitely one of, if not the best, TA I have ever had."

"Elayne has a gift for clearly explaining the key concepts of dense and complicated theories. She is
always ready for questions and willing to take the time to thoughtfully answer them."

"I really liked the way that Elayne explained things. She managed to make the readings very easy to
understand and was very accessible as a TA. I went to one of her office hours once and I left feeling like
I understood everything a lot better. She was also a fair grader and really took the time to put
meaningful comments on each of her student's midterms. Her optional review sessions also helped me
do well in the class."

"Elayne was very good at articulating the main ideas of the readings and explaining large concepts to
her sections. She also thoroughly made connections between the readings and the lectures and how
we might use them in an exam. She really helped me have a better understanding of the main ideas of
readings and lectures. I felt that if I was confused, she could explain it to me. I don't have much to say
about her weaknesses; I think she did great."

"I really liked Elayne, she is not only super knowledgable about the topics we discussed, but she is also
very open to other topics of discussion. I was a very nervous transfer student and felt super lost in class.
When I came to UCLA, and I had always been told reach out to the TA's and
I'm very happy that I reached out to Elayne. Elayne's strengths are that she is passionate about
teaching and student understanding even within a (somewhat) specialized course like War and
Diplomacy. She went above and beyond to create resources for our section that helped with reading
strategies, and organizing the theories within our class. SUPER HELPFUL. I dont really have a comment for 
improvement for Elayne because she was by far the most helpful individual I have
encountered at UCLA thus far."
