I am interested in understanding when and why marginalized individuals and groups engage in violence in the Global South. In my current work, I have a particular interest in identifying the psycho-social factors that influence the recurrence of violence (or not) and how addressing psycho-social barriers can facilitate the adoptions of alternatives to political violence.
