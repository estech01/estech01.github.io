I am interested in leveraging qualitative and statistical methods to investigate when and why people engage in group violence in the Global South. In particular, I am interested in the social and psychological factors that predict participation in political violence and the effect of persistent exposure to violence on individuals' attitudes, beliefs and political behaviors. I am also interested in the role of gender in post-conflict experiences and preferences.
