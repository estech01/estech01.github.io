In my current work, I am interested in understanding *why* marginalized individuals and groups engage in violence (or not), with a particular interest in identifying the psycho-social factors that influence the recurrence of violence (or not) and how addressing psycho-social barriers can facilitate the adoptions of alternatives to political violence. 

## Working Papers

*Removing Social Barriers to Womenâ€™s Candidacy* with C. Cruz and J. Kim

*Measuring Criminal Governance in Latin America* with B. Lessing, D. Block, N. Schouela and A. Uribe

## Additional Projects
