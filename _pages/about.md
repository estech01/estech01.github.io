# Conflict, interrupted.

How do psychological and social factors contribute to cycles of political violence? I use experiments, field research, and statistical analysis to try to drill down into the causes of conflict and barriers to peace in the Global South. Questions of particular interest to me are:

- Why do some conflicts recur while others do not?
- How do communities rebuild trust in the post-conflict period? 
- What are the psychosocial barriers to persistent peace, and how can policy makers address them?
- How do we ethically and effectively conduct research within conflict and post-conflict contexts?
- How can we make academia more available and legible to non-academics?

I am currently a PhD candidate in Policial Science at UCLA also pursuing a MS in Statistics (GPA: 4.0). I hold an MA in Political Science from UCLA (2022), an MA in International Relations from the University of Chicago (2019) and a BA in International Relations and Arabic from Tufts University (2014). I have conducted field research in Colombia (2024, 2023), Mexico (2023), Nigeria (2022), Iraq (2014), Jordan (2013, 2012), Nicaragua (2013) and Israel/Palestine (2012). I have also researched a varity of additional contexts, including Mali, Kashmir and Cambodia.
