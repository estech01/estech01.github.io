# Conflict, interrupted.

How can cycles of conflict can be interrupted, and what is the role of social structures in that endeavor? I use experiments, field research, and social network analysis to try to drill down into the causes of conflict and barriers to peace. Questions of particular interest to me are:

- What are the feasible alternatives to political violence for marginalized groups? 
- How do communities rebuild trust in the post-conflict period? 
- What are the (social) barriers to persistent peace, and how can those barriers be overcome?
- How do we ethically and effectively conduct research within conflict and post-conflict contexts?

I am currently a dual-degree student at UCLA pursuing a MA/PhD in Political Science and a MSc in Statistics. I hold an MA in International Relations from the Unviersity of Chicago (2019) and a BA in International Relations and Arabic from Tufts University (2014). I have previously lived in Jordan (2012) and Nicaragua (2013) and have conducted research in Israel/Palestine (2012), Jordan (2013) and Iraq (2014). I have also conducted research on a variety of additional contexts, including: Mexico, Jammu and Kashmir, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
