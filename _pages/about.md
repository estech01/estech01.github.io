# Conflict, interrupted.

How can cycles of conflict be interrupted, and what is the role of social structures in that endeavor? I use experiments, field research, statistical analysis and social network analysis to try to drill down into the causes of conflict and barriers to peace in the Global South. Questions of particular interest to me are:

- What predicts the recurrence of civil conflict?
- How do communities rebuild trust in the post-conflict period? 
- What are the psycho-social barriers to persistent peace, and how can those barriers be overcome?
- How do we ethically and effectively conduct research within conflict and post-conflict contexts?
- How can we make academia and academic writing more available and legible to non-academics?

I am currently a dual-degree student at UCLA pursuing a MA/PhD in Political Science and a MSc in Statistics. I hold an MA in International Relations from the University of Chicago (2019) and a BA in International Relations and Arabic from Tufts University (2014). I have spent time in Nigeria (2022), Iraq (2014), Jordan (2013, 2012), Nicaragua (2013) and Israel/Palestine (2012). I have also researched a varity of additional contexts, including Mexico, Kashmir, and Mali.
